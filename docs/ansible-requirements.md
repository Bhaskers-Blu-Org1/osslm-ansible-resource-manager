# ansible Playbooks and Roles
## Directory Structure
The RM expects to find your ansible resource types (i.e. your playbooks) in a folder in the _resource_ directory.
The folder structure MUST correspond to the naming of the resource type in the resource descriptor.

### Example Resource Type Naming
Resource descriptor:
```
name: resource::myres::1.1
```
Folder structure:
```
resources
    myres
    Â   1.1
          lifecycle/myplaybooks.yml
          descriptor/mydescriptor.yml
```

These sub-folders **MUST** exist for every resource:
* lifecycle  -  holds all playbooks and roles for all operations
* descriptor - holds your resource descriptor


## Naming
You **MUST** provide a playbook for each lifecycle transaction and each operation that is specified in your resource descriptor.
Playbooks can make use of roles. The top-level playbook naming is like this:
```
<name of operation>.yml
```
E.g. Install.yml, Start.yml, ...

## Resource Properites
**OPTIONALLY** you can report back _PROPERITES_ as a list of key/value pairs. This task can be used multiple times in your playbooks. New properties will simply be appended to the list.
It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the property-name.

```yaml
- name: report PROPERTIES
  debug:
    msg:
      - "server_name: {{ os_host['name']}}"
      - "mgmt_ip: {{ mgmt_ip }}"
      - "private_ip: {{ private_ip }}"

```
## Internal Instance Properites
**OPTIONALLY** you can report back _INTERNAL_PROPERITES_ as a list of key/value pairs. This task can be used multiple times in your playbooks. New properties will simply be appended to the list. These internal properties are stored in the cassandra DB and added to every transition request for the instance.
It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the property-name.

```yaml
- name: report INTERNAL_PROPERTIES
  debug:
    msg:
      - "instance_state: stopped"
      - "api_token: {{ api_token }}"

```
## Internal Resources
You must report back at least one _INTERNAL RESOURCES_ . This task can be used multiple times in your playbooks. New internal resources will simply be appended to the list.
Each internal resource is described by
- name
- id
- type

```yaml
- name: report INTERNAL_RESOURCE
  debug:
    msg:
     - "name: {{ server['ansible_facts']['openstack_servers'][0]['name'] }}"
     - "id: {{ server['ansible_facts']['openstack_servers'][0]['id'] }}"
     - "type: OS::Nova::Server"
```
